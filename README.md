# hello-world
This repository is for requirements of COMP 3521 at TRU

My name is Jordan, and I am studying computer science through the Open Learning program 
at Thompson Rivers University.  So far, I have completed the 3rd year requirements for the 
program, but still have one more year left.  

I have enjoyed some of the more technical courses, and although tiring and occassionally 
frustrating, I have found the work rewarding.  The COMP 3611 databases course was difficult,
but once I got the hang of it, it really wasn't so bad.  I can really feel that topics like
networks, operating systems, and computer systems relate to each other.  For example, 
many programs will need aspects of the theory in each of these courses to truly be
functional.  

Thanks for reading!
